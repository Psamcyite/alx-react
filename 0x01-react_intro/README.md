## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components." React has a component-based architecture, which promotes the reusability of UI elements and makes it easier to manage the state of your application. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, it's recommended to have a basic understanding of:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js and npm (for running React applications)

## Getting Started

1. **Setting up Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Verify your installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

2. **Creating a New React Application**:
   - Use the following command to create a new React application:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-react-app
     ```
   - Replace `my-react-app` with the desired name of your project.
   
3. **Starting the Development Server**:
   - Change into your project directory:
     ```bash
     cd my-react-app
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Your React application will be running at `http://localhost:3000/`. Any changes you make to the source files will automatically reload the application.

## Examples

This repository includes simple examples and exercises to help you understand the core concepts of React, including:

- **Functional Components**: Learn how to create functional components, the building blocks of React applications.
- **Class Components**: Explore class components and understand their lifecycle methods.
- **State and Props**: Understand how to manage state and pass data between components using props.
- **Event Handling**: Learn how to handle user interactions and events in React.
- **Hooks**: Discover React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to add state and side-effects to functional components.
- **Routing**: Implement basic routing in a React application using React Router.

Each example comes with detailed comments to explain the code and concepts.
