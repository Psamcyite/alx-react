# Webpack Configuration

## Overview

This repository contains the configuration files for setting up Webpack in your JavaScript projects. Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes your code and assets, such as CSS and images, and bundles them together in a way that's optimized for the web. This README provides instructions on how to use and customize the Webpack configuration to fit your project's needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Psamcyite/alx-react.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd alx-react
    ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

### Development Mode

To run your project in development mode with hot module replacement, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start a local development server and open your application in your default web browser. The server will automatically reload your application whenever you make changes to the source files.

### Production Build

To build your project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create optimized and minified bundles of your code and assets in the `dist` directory.

## Configuration

The Webpack configuration is split into multiple files within the `config` directory:

- `webpack.common.js`: Contains the common configuration used in both development and production builds.
- `webpack.dev.js`: Contains configuration specific to the development environment.
- `webpack.prod.js`: Contains configuration specific to the production environment.

You can customize these configuration files according to your project requirements. For example, you can add loaders, plugins, or modify the entry/output points.

## Additional Features

- **Code Splitting**: Webpack allows you to split your code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on-demand.
- **Loaders**: Use loaders to process files as they are imported into your application. For example, you can use Babel loader to transpile JavaScript code.
- **Plugins**: Plugins are powerful tools that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as minification, environment variables injection, and more.
